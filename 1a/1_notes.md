EC2 → RDS Integration Lab

Foundational Cloud Application Pattern

Project Overview (What You Are Building) In this lab, you will build a classic cloud application architecture: A compute layer running on an Amazon EC2 instance A managed relational database hosted on Amazon RDS Secure connectivity between the two using VPC networking and security groups Credential management using AWS Secrets Manager A simple application that writes and reads data from the database
The application itself is intentionally minimal. The learning value is not the app, but the cloud infrastructure pattern it demonstrates.

This pattern appears in: Internal enterprise tools SaaS products Backend APIs Legacy modernization projects Lift-and-shift workloads Cloud security assessments

If you can build and verify this pattern, you understand the foundation of real AWS workloads.

Why This Lab Exists (Industry Context) This Is One of the Most Common Interview Architectures Employers routinely expect engineers to understand: How EC2 communicates with RDS How database access is restricted Where credentials are stored How connectivity is validated How failures are debugged
You will encounter variations of this question in: AWS Solutions Architect interviews Cloud Security roles DevOps and SRE interviews Incident response scenarios

If you cannot explain this pattern clearly, you will struggle in real cloud environments.

Why This Pattern Matters to the Workforce What Employers Are Actually Testing This lab evaluates whether you understand:
Skill Why It Matters Security Groups Primary AWS network security boundary Least Privilege Prevents credential leakage & lateral movement Managed Databases Operational responsibility vs infrastructure IAM Roles Eliminates static credentials Application-to-DB Trust Core of backend security

This is not a toy problem. This is how real systems are built.

Architectural Design (Conceptual) Logical Flow
A user sends an HTTP request to an EC2 instance
The EC2 application: Retrieves database credentials from Secrets Manager Connects to the RDS MySQL endpoint
Data is written to or read from the database
Results are returned to the user
Security Model RDS is not publicly accessible RDS only allows inbound traffic from the EC2 security group EC2 retrieves credentials dynamically via IAM role No passwords are stored in code or AMIs

This is intentional friction — security is part of the design.

Expected Deliverables (What You Must Produce) Each student must submit:
A. Infrastructure Proof

EC2 instance running and reachable over HTTP
RDS MySQL instance in the same VPC
Security group rule showing: RDS inbound TCP 3306 Source = EC2 security group (not 0.0.0.0/0) IAM role attached to EC2 allowing Secrets Manager access
B. Application Proof

Successful database initialization
Ability to insert records into RDS
Ability to read records from RDS
C. Verification Evidence

CLI output proving connectivity and configuration
Browser output showing database data
Technical Verification Using AWS CLI (Mandatory) You are expected to prove your work using the CLI — not screenshots alone.
6.1 Verify EC2 Instance aws ec2 describe-instances
--filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=lab-ec2-app"
--query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId" Expected: Instance ID returned Instance state = running

6.2 Verify IAM Role Attached to EC2 aws ec2 describe-instances
--instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID>
--query "Reservations[].Instances[].IamInstanceProfile.Arn"

Expected: ARN of an IAM instance profile (not null)

6.3 Verify RDS Instance State aws rds describe-db-instances
--db-instance-identifier lab-mysql
--query "DBInstances[].DBInstanceStatus"

Expected Available

6.4 Verify RDS Endpoint (Connectivity Target) aws rds describe-db-instances
--db-instance-identifier lab-mysql
--query "DBInstances[].Endpoint"

Expected: Endpoint address Port 3306

6.5 Verify Security Group Rules (Critical) RDS Security Group Inbound Rules aws ec2 describe-security-groups
--group-names sg-rds-lab
--query "SecurityGroups[].IpPermissions"

Expected: TCP port 3306 Source referencing EC2 security group ID, not CIDR

6.6 Verify Secrets Manager Access (From EC2) SSH into EC2 and run: aws secretsmanager get-secret-value
--secret-id lab/rds/mysql

Expected: JSON containing: username password host port

If this fails, IAM is misconfigured.

6.7 Verify Database Connectivity (From EC2) Install MySQL client (temporary validation): sudo dnf install -y mysql

Connect: mysql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u admin -p

Expected: Successful login No timeout or connection refused errors

6.8 Verify Data Path End-to-End From browser: http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/init http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/add?note=cloud_labs_are_real http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/list

Expected: Notes persist across refresh Data survives application restart

Common Failure Modes (And What They Teach)
Failure Lesson Connection timeout Security group or routing issue Access denied IAM or Secrets Manager misconfiguration App starts but DB fails Dependency order matters Works once then breaks Stateless compute vs stateful DB

Every failure here mirrors real production outages.

What This Lab Proves About You If you complete this lab correctly, you can say: “I understand how real AWS applications securely connect compute to managed databases.”
That is a non-trivial claim in the job market.
